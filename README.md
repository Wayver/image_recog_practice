At the current stage, the challenge is to accurately identify dates and events from the calendar by filtering an image to find the areas that represent each date.

The next step will be to scrape each relevant area for text, and then to use calendar APIs to create new events for selected dates.

The final stage will be to package the functionality into a mobile app and allow the user to select the dates/they want from the touchscreen.
